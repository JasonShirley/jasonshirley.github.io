# Work History

## Full Stack Developer: BasicSoft - Fruitland Idaho(April 2019 - April 2020)
My first job out of college was with BasicSoft. I worked as a full stack developer developing new features and fixes for their flagship product, BasicSafe. Out of the gate I had to learn a brand-new technology stack that I wasn't familiar with, the LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP) stack. From day one I dug in and worked fast to learn a product that was new to me while learning to code with my new technology stack.
<br>
<br>
One of the most important skills I learned from this job was effective communication. I had to learn to adapt my communication to explain complex concepts and ideas to clients in a manner that would make sense to them.  My job was customer facing at times, meaning that I would have to communicate with stakeholders about their projects that they paid for. It was my duty to learn how to communicate to individuals of all skill levels so that they could feel confident in the work that I would do.

## SCADA Developer: NStar Global Services/Micron Technologies - Boise Idaho (Jun 2020 - May 2021)
During the summer of 2020 I was approached by NStar Global Services to do SCADA development for Micron Technologies. My main job responsibilites at this job was to design front end solutions and input data that PLCs would interface with utilizing WonderWare HMI. I worked on multi-million dollar projects building out and configuring interfaces that would interact with PLCs controlling HVAC and Water systems.
<br>
<br>
I worked closely with engineers on the ground floor to ensure that all frontend interfaces were configured properly. This required me to communicate effectively with engineers utilizing slack, email, and phone messages. I also met with stakeholders regularly to ensure that factory equipment was functioning as intended in regards to front end interaction.
<br>
<br>
## Software Engineer: Concept Systems Inc - Albany Oregon (May 2021 - August 2021)
At Concept Systems I worked on an emerging product called LabDash whose function was to track COVID-19 cases. I worked on a LAMP stack to build, test, and deploy new features and bug fixes. I regularly met with stakeholders to understand their needs in building new functionality for LabDash. I assited in the planning and execution of migrating their sourcecode to Git. I also provided assistance in cleaning their legacy code to be more readable and functional.
